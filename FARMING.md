|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Right-click**         | Add a waypoint with no actions, or remove an existing waypoint at that position                    |
| **Shift + Right-click** | Add a waypoint and immediately open the Action Editor, or edit the actions of an existing waypoint |

### Nuker Behavior

- Default toggle keybind: **X**
- Starts at the first waypoint and applies its action.
- When the player reaches the next waypoint, it advances automatically.
- Pauses on pest spawn, swaps to Mossy armor + Pest equipment, and waits for the player to kill the pest manually.
- After killing a pest, warps back to the Garden and resumes.
- Stops on: world change, teleport, rotation change, or held item swap.
